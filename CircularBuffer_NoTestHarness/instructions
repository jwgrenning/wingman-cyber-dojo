Objective
---------
Write a CircularBuffer module in c and make sure it works.

Requirements
------------
* A CircularBuffer is sized during create.
* It stores integers.
* It is FIFO.
* It can report its total capacity
* It can report it is empty
* It can report it is full
* Putting to a full CircularBuffer
  * returns false
  * loses no prior values
* Getting from an empty CircularBuffer returns a
  default value provided during create.

For this exercise, do not worry about:
--------------------------------------
* Null pointers
* Concurrency

Starting point
--------------
You have the CircularBuffer interface in CircularBuffer.h.
You must develop to that interface.  The architects said so.
You have all the files you need, and should not need to
change 

Instructions
------------
Do all your work from within this cyber-dojo environment.
Pressing the 'test' button saves, builds and then runs your code.

Write CircularBuffer.c.  Once it compiles, test that the
CircularBuffer is working.  Use the provided main.c to exercise
your CircularBuffer.  Feel free to use printf of whatever you
would normally do.  Do not use any unit test framework.

Note in main.c that there is a 'exercise_state' variable.
It is initially set to 'writing'.  Once you finish writing
code, and are going to start testing, set the variable to
'testing'. Once you are satisfied that your code works, set it 
to 'working'. 

Email research -at- wingman-sw.com when you have completed you
CircularBuffer.

Controlling the cyber-dojo test environment
-------------------------------------------
Cyber-dojo does not work so great with IE, so please use another browser.

Compile and run main.c by pressing the 'test' button.  Shortcut key alt-t.

If you need to do a clean build, edit cyber-dojo.sh.  You'll see commented
out code to make clean.
