Objective
---------
Write a CircularBuffer module in c and make sure it works.

Requirements
------------
* A CircularBuffer is sized during create.
* It stores integers.
* It is FIFO.
* It can report its total capacity
* It can report if it is empty
* It can report if it is full
* Putting to a full CircularBuffer
  * returns false
  * loses no prior values
* Getting from an empty CircularBuffer returns a
  default value provided during create function.

For this exercise, do not worry about:
--------------------------------------
* Null pointers
* Concurrency

Starting point
--------------
The CircularBuffer interface is defined in CircularBuffer.h.
You must develop to that interface.  The architects said so.
You have all the files you need, and should not need to
add files or modify the makefile.

Instructions
------------
Do all your work from within this cyber-dojo environment.
Pressing the 'test' button saves, builds and then runs your code.

Write CircularBuffer.c.  Once it compiles, test that the
CircularBuffer is working.  Use the provided main.c to exercise
your CircularBuffer.  Feel free to use printf or whatever you
would normally do.  Do not use any unit test framework.
Please do all your work in this cyber-dojo environment.

NOTE: In main.c that there is a 'exercise_state' variable.
It is initially set to 'writing'.  Once you finish writing
code, and are going to start testing, set the variable to
'testing'. Once you are satisfied that your code works, set it 
to 'working'. 

Email research -at- wingman-sw.com when you have completed you
CircularBuffer.

Controlling the cyber-dojo test environment
-------------------------------------------
Cyber-dojo does not work so great with IE, so please use 
Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or another browser.

Compile and run main.c by pressing the 'test' button.  The
shortcut key is alt-t.

If you need to do a clean build, edit cyber-dojo.sh to make clean.
You'll see commented out code in cyber-dojo.sh to make clean.
