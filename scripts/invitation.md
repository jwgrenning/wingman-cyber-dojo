Hi

####Thank you for your interest in my exercise! 

You will see a few questions to answer in the 'instructions' file.  Please don’t  provide any information you do not want on the open web.

If you can complete the exercise over the next few days or week that would be great.  Longer is OK too.  Let me know what to expect and send me the URL of your exercise when you are finished. Do all your editing, compiling, and testing in my exercise environment.

Please press the test button in the exercise just before you write your first line code. Let me know about typos or directions that are not clear.

There are four versions of the exercise, please only select one.  Please select one link, and then only if you plan on completing the exercise. (it uses one of the 64 exercise slots).  Give yourself a couple hours to complete the exercise.
