Hi

####Thank you for joining my exercise! 

You will see a few questions to answer in the 'instructions' file.  Please don’t  provide any information you do not want on the open web.

If you can complete the exercise over the next few days or week that would be great.  Longer is OK too.  Let me know what to expect and send me the URL of your exercise when you are finished. Do all your editing, compiling, and testing in my exercise environment.

Please press the test button in the exercise as soon as you write your first line code. Let me know about typos or directions that are not clear.

Please only press one link, and then only if you plan on completing the exercise. (it uses one of the 64 exercise slots).  Give yourself a couple hours to complete the exercise.

Choose the exercise with or without a test harness based on your usual practices.
