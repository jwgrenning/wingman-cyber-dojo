I will not reveal \nyour name, unless you want me too.  If you choose to tweet\nabout the exercise, please tag me @jwgrenning.\n\nAbout you\n---------\nI am a 26 years old embedded systems engineer working \nin the watch industry on quartz movements. \n\nWhat is your level of C experience (delete choices that are not you)?\n- I program in C everyday\n\nPlease say something about your engineering/programming background:\nI've written firmware for basic watches as well as for connected watches \nand non-connected ones embedding multiple sensors and algorithms. \nI've also written many Python scripts and GUI. \n\nPUSH THE TEST BUTTON NOW TO SAVE YOUR WORK AND\nRECORD THE START TIME OF YOUR EXERCISE.\n\nIf you take some breaks during the exercise, please add\nthe time and duration of your break here.\n\nWill you do (please delete all but one choice):\n- test-driven\n\nObjective\n---------\nWrite a CircularBuffer and make sure it works.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n* A CircularBuffer is sized during create.\n* It stores integers.\n* It is FIFO.\n* It can report its total capacity\n* It can report if it is empty\n* It can report if it is full\n* Putting to a full CircularBuffer\n  * preserves prior values\n  * returns false\n* Getting from an empty CircularBuffer returns a\n  default value provided during create function.\n* When you are finished, your production code should \n  run without printing anything.\n* Make your code clean and readable, something you'd\n  attach to your resume.\n\nFor this exercise, do not worry about:\n--------------------------------------\n* Null pointers\n* Concurrency\n* malloc or calloc failures\n\nCircularBuffer Diagram\n----------------------\nwww.wingman-sw.com/files/cyber-dojo/CircularBuffer.pdf\n\nStarting point\n--------------\nThe CircularBuffer interface is defined in CircularBuffer.h.\nYou must develop your implementation to that interface.  \nThe architects said so.\n\nYou have all the files you need, and should not need to\nadd files or modify the makefile.\n\nInstructions\n------------\nDo all your work from within this cyber-dojo environment.\nPressing the 'test' button saves, builds and then runs your code.\n\nWrite and test CircularBuffer.  Use the provided CircularBufferTest.cpp\nto exercise your CircularBuffer.  Add as many test cases \nas you need.\n\nPlease do all your work in this cyber-dojo environment.\n\nIf you take any breaks, please let me know the approximate \ncycle number (upper right side of the red, green and \nyellow traffic lights) and duration.\nbreak 1 : cycle 24, 20min\n\nNOTE: In the main file, that there is a 'exercise_state' variable.\nIt is initially set to 'writing'.  Once you finish writing\ncode, and are going to start testing, set the variable to\n'testing'. Once you are satisfied that your code works, set it \nto 'working'.  If you are test-driving, there is a setting for you\ntoo.\n\nEmail the URL of your exercises to 'research -at- wingman-sw.com'\nwhen you have completed your CircularBuffer.\n\nControlling the cyber-dojo test environment\n-------------------------------------------\nCyber-dojo does not work so great with IE, so please use \nChrome, Firefox, Safari, or another browser.\n\nCompile and run by pressing the 'test' button.
