starting.  \n\nEmail research -at- wingman-sw.com with questions or suggestions.  \n\nAbout you\n---------\nPlease add some information about youself when you start the\nexercise. Pressing the 'test' button saves all\nyour edits.  I may email you about your exercise and what I \ndiscover.\n\nYou should consider your code public, I may respectively\ninclude it in tweets or blog articles. I will not reveal \nyour name, unless you want me too.  If you choose to tweet\nabout the exercise, please tag me @jwgrenning.\n\nWhat is your level of C experience (delete choices that are not you)?\n- I program in C everyday\n\nPlease say something about your engineering/programming background:\nI primarily program in C for embedded devices (not really resource/memory\nconstrained though, just restricted to compilers for C). I have been working\nas a software engineer for the past 8 years and have a masters degree in\nComputer Science.\n\nPUSH THE TEST BUTTON NOW TO SAVE YOUR WORK AND\nRECORD THE START TIME OF YOUR EXERCISE.\n\nIf you take some breaks during the exercise, please add\nthe time and durattion of your break here.\n\nWill you do (please delete all but one choice):\n- test-driven\n\nObjective\n---------\nWrite a CircularBuffer module in c and make sure it works.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n* A CircularBuffer is sized during create.\n* It stores integers.\n* It is FIFO.\n* It can report its total capacity\n* It can report if it is empty\n* It can report if it is full\n* Putting to a full CircularBuffer\n  * returns false\n  * preserves prior values\n* Getting from an empty CircularBuffer returns a\n  default value provided during create function.\n* When you are finished, your production code should \n  run silently; your test code can make noise.\n* Make your code clean and readble, something you'd\n  attach to your resume.\n\nFor this exercise, do not worry about:\n--------------------------------------\n* Null pointers\n* Concurrency\n* malloc or calloc failures\n\nCircularBuffer Diagram\n----------------------\nwww.wingman-sw.com/files/cyber-dojo/CircularBuffer.pdf\n\nStarting point\n--------------\nThe CircularBuffer interface is defined in CircularBuffer.h.\nYou must develop your implementation to that interface.  \nThe architects said so.\n\nYou have all the files you need, and should not need to\nadd files or modify the makefile.\n\nInstructions\n------------\nDo all your work from within this cyber-dojo environment.\nPressing the 'test' button saves, builds and then runs your code.\n\nWrite CircularBuffer.c.  Once it compiles, test that the\nCircularBuffer is working.  Use the provided main.c to exercise\nyour CircularBuffer.\n\nPlease do all your work in this cyber-dojo environment.\n\nIf you take any breaks, please let me know the approximate \ncycle number (upper right side of the red, green and \nyellow traffic lights) and duration.\n\nNOTE: In the main file, that there is a 'exercise_state' variable.\nIt is initially set to 'writing'.  Once you finish writing\ncode, and are going to start testing, set the variable to\n'testing'. Once you are satisfied that your code works, set it \nto 'working'.  If you are test-driving, there is a setting for you\ntoo.\n\nEmail research -at- wingman-sw.com when you have completed your\nCircularBuffer.\n\nControlling the cyber-dojo test environment\n-------------------------------------------\nCyber-dojo does not work so great with IE, so please use \nChrome, Firefox, Safari, or another browser.\n\nCompile and run main.c by pressing the 'test' button.  The\nshortcut key is alt-t.\n\nIf you need to do a clean build, edit cyber-dojo.sh to make clean.\nYou'll see commented out code in cyber-dojo.sh to make clean.\n\n","output":"compiling CircularBufferTest.cpp\nLinking CircularBuffer_tests\n/cpputest/build/MakefileWorker.mk:481: recipe for target 'CircularBuffer_tests' failed\nobjs/CircularBufferTest.o: In function `TEST_CircularBuffer_putReturnsTrueWhenEmpty_Test::testBody()':\n/sandboxes/salmon/CircularBufferTest.cpp:56: undefined reference to `CircularBuffer_Put'\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake: *** [CircularBuffer_tests] Error 1\n"}
