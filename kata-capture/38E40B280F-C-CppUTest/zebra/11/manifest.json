I may email you about your exercise and what I \ndiscover.\n\nYou should consider your code public, I may respectively\ninclude it in tweets or blog articles. I will not reveal \nyour name, unless you want me too.

Once it compiles, test that the\nCircularBuffer is working.  Use the provided main.c to exercise\nyour CircularBuffer.\n\nPlease do all your work in this cyber-dojo environment.\n\nNOTE: In the main file, that there is a 'exercise_state' variable.\nIt is initially set to 'writing'.  Once you finish writing\ncode, and are going to start testing, set the variable to\n'testing'. Once you are satisfied that your code works, set it \nto 'working'.  If you are test-driving, there is a setting for you\ntoo.\n\nEmail research -at- wingman-sw.com when you have completed your\nCircularBuffer.\n\nControlling the cyber-dojo test environment\n-------------------------------------------\nCyber-dojo does not work so great with IE, so please use \nChrome, Firefox, Safari, or another browser.\n\nCompile and run main.c by pressing the 'test' button.
